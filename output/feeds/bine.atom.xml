&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last summer 2022 I joined a creative pop-up space in an old train station in the small rural town of Herzberg (Elster). I designed the website „Herzbahnhof“ for two reasons. First, provide detailed information to Herzberg's citzens and interested persons about the temporary creative space. Second, collect ideas from the website's visitors about how the old train station could be used in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="back button" src="/images/herzbhf.png" title="image of Herzbahnhof landing page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Research &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figma, Miro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML, CSS, JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;
Qualitative interviewing of visitors in the pop-up space revealed a wealth of thoughts and ideas about the future of the train station. But how could more voices be heard and a higher quantitity of ideas be collected? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;
I decided to support the idea collection with an online form on a website of the building. An easy and straightforward way to let people contribute their ideas in a simple form placed in the center of the landing page. Finally, the collected data should inspire more elaborate concepts about the building's prospective utilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data collection and analysis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the interviews, I extracted the participants' ideas and sorted them into clusters. The analysis revealed two main projections for the building's "identity", made up out of its historic retrospective and future continuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="clusters" src="/images/miro.png" title="idea clusters past future"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two main dimensions needed to be represented on the "Herzbahnhof" website. A navigation bar was created, with two menu items and respective page sections that would provide detailed information regarding the past and future of the train station. To draw users' attention to these notions, the navbar is kept simple with only these to menu items ("Geschichte" and "Perspektiven"). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing the navigation menu wording:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three test persons were asked for their preference regarding the nav items' wording. They rejected the term "future" for its absoluteness. Instead, the term was exchanged by the more open and flexible "Perspektiven", indicating the subjective nature of the ideas for the building's possible future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback on successful form input was required by all test users. A page was added which is now displayed on form submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="feedback page" src="/images/danke.png" title="danke für Ihre Idee!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI DESIGN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form elements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the navigation bar, the other central element on the landing page is the form. Placed below in the center between past and future below the navigation, it refers to the present time. I chose a yellow background, a signal colour, that it used on train station timetables to indicate departure times of trains. The font type is kept in a style similar to the proprietary DB type. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a logo to communicate the uniqueness of the building as reported in the interviews with the Herzberg inhabitants. It shows a heart and the German abbreviation "Bhf" for train station inside, which refers to a pun made up from the words Herzberg and Bahnhof "Herzbahnhof". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="logo" src="/images/logo.png" title="herzbhf logo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEVELOPMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implemented the website with Visual Studio Code and common web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) while using as little client-side rendering as possible, for mindful energy use. I included a Google-Api for an online spreadsheet which serves as a database for user data inputted via the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE AWAYS &amp;amp; LEARNINGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing for digitally enabled citizen participation implies expertise about the procedures and implementation of local politics. Questions were raised by Herzberg's inhabitants about the purpose of the idea collection regarding any impacts on the old train station as a public space. For these reasons, I decided not to deploy the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A focus on either UI/UX design, user research, technical development or on product management is recommended when creating digitial applications which may have political impact.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The garden app is a mobile application for interacting with a garden environment and learning about its ecosystems. A mobile augmented reality app was created in an iterative process, using low-fidelity mockups and hi-fi prototypes built with Unity. By taking a &lt;em&gt;user-centered design&lt;/em&gt; approach, a complex interplay of different UX factors were revealed and the design could be optimised. As a result, the garden app is now an inspiring tool in the eyes of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wf" src="/images/gardenapp2a.png" title="gardenapp wireframe"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; How can people reconnect with nature? Interviews with inhabitants who live in urban spaces showed that all wish to spend more time in nature yet spend more actual time with their digital devices and detached from their immediate surroundings. A deep connection with nature is commonly associated with wellbeing. How to achieve it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; An augmented reality app that blends the digital space and a garden space - a mobile app that incites users to interact with the garden and learn more about its ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data collection with interviews:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-depth interviews with 11 people were conducted. Reconnecting with and gaining more knowledge about nature were important to all participants. As a design requirement, the app should replicate the process of understanding how plants and insects are interconnected and serve each other. This required some followup &lt;em&gt;research into natural ecosystems&lt;/em&gt; to inform the app design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In permaculture, which is a popular agriculture design theory and system, so called 'plant guilds' describe a symbiotic co-existance in nature. The permaculture principles were replicated in the garden app design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UX DESIGN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Flow:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user trajectory was created upon a path as design pattern. On the path, 'guilding' garden plants, such as thyme, borage, and broccoli, are visited by users. Screens and camera on the device alternate while the user is exploring the outdoor surrounding. User instructions are displayed and the camera is used for automatic recording of physical markers which trigger the AR experience. Information in the blended space motivate users to directly engage with the garden plants, e.g. "smell", or "taste".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wf" src="/images/userflow.png" title="gardenapp userflow"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USER TESTING &amp;amp; EVALUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User testing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For user testing, wireframe screens of garden app were created and tested, supported by the &lt;em&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt; technique. The first iteration with three participants showed unfamiliarity with AR technology, i.e. scanning of physical markers to capture objects and augmented information. Another issue were augmented buttons which weren't obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next iteration the above issues were adressed: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A screen was added with a short and clear instruction how to display augmented information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AR-buttons were redesigned to have a similar screen location as the conventional (non-AR) buttons from the previous screens. With this, the AR-buttons could be easily recognised by the users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screens_buttons" src="/images/buttons_same.png" title="wireframes_buttons"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User testing outdoors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a high-fidelity prototype of the garden app was implemented using Unity and tested in the garden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="map" src="/images/gardenmap.png" title="outdoor testing"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outdoor user testing with this design iteration revealed severe accessibilty issues: The users needed to crouch and move their device closely to the marker and plant object in order to decipher the augmented information. An issue that did not occur in a sitting position in the previous testings with the lo-fi prototypes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;healing of the invisible / inaccessible content issue was attempted by resizing the information in the AR-layers   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questionaire and post-testing interview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For UX assessment after testing, an AttrakDiff questionaire as well as short interviews were used. The participants reported an enjoyable engagement with the blended garden spaces and deep sensual experiences in the garden when using the garden app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE AWAY &amp;amp; LEARNING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AR-layers in a mobile app need to be especially accessible due to additional UX factors in the physical space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deepened connection with natural environments can be experienced when using the garden app via AR technology&lt;/li&gt;
