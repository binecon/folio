Summary: Connecting mobile users with an outdoor garden space 

**Connecting users with an outdoor garden space** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden app is a mobile application for interacting with a garden environment and learning about its ecosystems. A mobile augmented reality app was created with a variety of media, ranging from low-fidelity mockups to hi-fi prototypes built with Unity. User testing revealed a complex UX concept which required very careful design iterations. As a result, the garden app is an inspiring tool in the eyes of its users.

**Roles:** User Research / UX Design

**Tools:** Figma / Gimp / Unity

--------

**Challenge:** In-depth interviews of people who live in urban spaces showed that all wish to spend more time in nature yet spent more actual time with their digital devices and detached from the immediate surrounding. A good connection with nature is associated with wellbeing. How can people reconnect with nature?

**Solution:** Using an augmented reality app that blends the digital and garden spaces. An app that incites users to interact with the garden's ecosystems.

**RESEARCH**

**Data collection with interviews and questionaires:**

Qualitative data from interviews shows previous connection.
Connection with nature in the participants showed that they see inherent regularities. Searching for them. System requirement: Simulate the process of understanding how each plants and insects are interconnected. Required some followup *research into natural ecosystems:* in order to reproduce them in the app design.

Different kinds of questionaires were used to

------
**DESIGN**

**User Flow:**

A user trajectory was created upon a path on which a group of 'guilding' garden plants can be visited, such as thyme, borage, and broccoli. On the mobile device, screens and camera alternate while the user is exploring the outdoor surrounding. The screens show user instructions and the camera is used for automatic recording in order to scan physical markers which trigger the AR experience. The AR layer that the users access instructs to directly engage with the garden plants, e.g. "smell", or "taste".

**USER TESTING & EVALUATION**

**Hi-fi prototype testing:**

User testing showed that engagement with the garden having a good experience and spent time with it.

**Questionaire**

After testing the users were requested to answer a AttrakDiff questionaire. Theae were the results:
+ very attractive
+ educative
+ intriguing
+ innovative

-----

**CONCLUSION & LEARNINGS**

+ Accesibility with AR is complex
+ Technical limitations
+ Spending more time in natrual is a real requirement
