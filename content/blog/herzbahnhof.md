Summary: Creating a website to promote rural development 

**Creating a website to promote rural development** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last summer 2022 I joined a creative pop-up space in the small rural town of Herzberg (Elster) which had been established in an old train station. <br/>I designed the website of „Herzbahnhof“ for two reasons:
First, provide detailed information to Herzberg's citzens about the temporary creative space.
Second, collect ideas from the website's visitors about how the old train station could be used in future.

**Roles:**

+ User Research 
+ UI Design
+ Web development

**Tools:**

+ Figma, Miro
+ Visual Studio Code
+ HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Challenge:**
Qualitative interviewing of visitors in the pop-up space revealed a wealth of thoughts and ideas about the future of the train station. But how could more voices be heard and a higher quantitity of ideas be collected? 

**Solution:**
I decided to support the idea collection with an online form on a website of the building. An easy and straightforward way to let people contribute their ideas in a simple form placed in the center of the landing page. Finally, the collected data should inspire more elaborate concepts about the building's prospective utilisation.

**RESEARCH**

**Data collection and analysis:**

From the interviews, I extracted the participants' main ideas and sorted them into clusters. The analysis revealed two main projections for the building's "identity", made up out of its historic retrospective and future continuation.

Thus, these two main dimensions needed to be represented on the website. A navigation bar appeared to best convey this concept, with two menu items and respective page sections that would provide detailed information regarding the past and future of the train station. To draw the users' attention to these main dimensions in the home page, the navbar is kept simple with only these to items ("Geschichte" and "Perspektiven"). 

**Testing the navigation menu wording:**

Three test persons were asked for their preference regarding the nav items wording. As a main finding the users rejected the term "future" for its absoluteness. Instead, the term was exchanged by the more open and flexible "Perspektiven", indicating the subjective nature of the ideas for the building's possible future.

**UI DESIGN**

**Form elements:**

Apart from the navigation bar, the other central element on the landing page is the idea posting form. Placed below in the center between past and future below the navigation, it can be recognised as the present dimension. I chose a yellow background, a signal colour, that it used on train station timetables to indicate departure times of trains. The font is in a style similar to the proprietary DB type. 

**Logo:**

I created a logo to communicate the uniqueness of the building as reported in the interviews with the Herzberg inhabitants. It shows a heart and the German abbreviation for train station inside, which refers to a pun made up from the words Herzberg and Bahnhof "Herzbahnhof".

**DEVELOPMENT**

I implemented the website using Visual Studio Code and common web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), but using as little client-side rendering as possible, for mindful energy use. For the input data via the form, I included a Google-Api an online spreadsheet to serve as a database for the user data.

**CONCLUSION & LEARNINGS**

+ citizen participation raises many questions, expressing political will, extremely important for user research, requires experienced researchers in the service design
+ time management challenge when hacving diffferent roles, UI design vs user research vs dev
+ its a requirement to have digital represnetations of urban planning, very interesring field
