**Creating a website to promote urban developement** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last summer I joined the Summer of Pioneers community in Herzberg (Elster). Herzbahnhof is the name of a temporary, pop-up space in a train station, established to find an adequate reutilisation of the building.  be inspired by citizens and funded by the municipality.
The website of „Herzbahnhof“ was designed for two reasons:
First, provide detailed information about the building to citizens of Herzberg and beyond.
Second, collect ideas from its visitors about how the old train station could be used in future.
